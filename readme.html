Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?
I decided to view an older version of YouTube as it's a site that I use everyday. I viewed multiple versions but the biggest visual contrast was between current day YouTube and versions between 2005-2008. Overall the older versions aren't as visually appealing and the site feels more free-form as the styles content creators had for their content was more casual and didn't really correlate to any particular trends (at least from my perspective).
Current-day YouTube is a lot cleaner and does a lot better job of filtering based on user preferences and search/watch history as their technology has improved.
