Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
Div elements were really difficult to get a handle on and I still have a lot of work to do in that regard. I found HTML to be really fun to play around with and I am pleasantly surprised with how
much I've learned in this period of time. The ability to combine so many different elements and sources and to have all of your pages interconnected is, while simple, a rewarding process.
After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I'm excited to keep learning through this course and to tackle something a bit different.
