How did your user testing sessions go?
Since I'm a bit behind on my final project there was not too much for users to interact with on my website but I got a lot of good ideas in preparation for the final version in regards to content, overall design, and the user experience.
What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I still need to create two additional pages which will offer more usability overall; however, the biggest thing that needs to be addressed is enhancing the viewability of the website so that it is more aesthetically pleasing and less clunky.
Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
I still need to put in a lot of work in for this website to be worthy of being considered my final project but I'll be working diligently this week to create a website that captures all of the lessons I've learned this semester!
